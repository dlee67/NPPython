Started to get the hang of http headers; in order to test my understanding, I've decided to 
add an http header Accept-Charset with ASCII, where I expected only English to appear; however,
everything about the website I've requested http for gave me what I usually see.

Intuitively, I am guessing adjustments in the http header and requesting doesn't
mean the server can adhere to it.
